To enable this Power-Up for your Trello boards, you'll need to go here:

ðŸ‘‰  [https://trello.com/power-ups/admin](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin)

Select the Trello team you want to add the Power-Up to. Note: You need to be an admin of the Trello team to add custom Power-Ups to it.

Now click the `Create new Power-Up` button. If this is your first time adding a Power-Up, you'll need to agree to a "Joint Developer Agreement" first. After you have done that, you just need to give your Power-Up a name, and paste this app's manifest url, `https://trello-iframe.glitch.me/manifest.json`.

Click `Save` and it's time to celebrate ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽŠ

Now when you look at the Power-Ups for any board in that team, this Power-Up will be available. Enable it and you'll be able to set costs for cards when you open them. If you'd like to add functionality, you can fork this Glitch project and edit the source as you please.
