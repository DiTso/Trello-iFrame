    <p>
      To enable this Power-Up for your Trello boards, you'll need to go here:
    </p>
    
    <p>
    ðŸ‘‰  <a href="https://trello.com/power-ups/admin">https://trello.com/power-ups/admin</a>      
    </p>

    <p>
      Select the Trello team you want to add the Power-Up to. Note: You need to be an admin of the Trello team to add custom Power-Ups to it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Now click the <code>Create new Power-Up</code> button. If this is your first time adding a Power-Up, you'll need to agree to a "Joint Developer Agreement" first. After you have done that, you just need to give your Power-Up a name, and paste this app's manifest url, <code>https://trello-iframe.glitch.me/manifest.json</code>.      
    </p>

    <p>
      Click <code>Save</code> and it's time to celebrate ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽŠ
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Now when you look at the Power-Ups for any board in that team, this Power-Up will be available. Enable it and you'll be able to open an iFrame directly in your Trello board! If you'd like to add functionality, you can fork this <a href="https://glitch.com/~trello-iframe">Glitch project</a> and edit the source as you please.      
      <ul>
        <li>Typing a URL will open the board bar to that URL.  The URL must support iFraming or it will not open properly.</li>
        <li>Typing in </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
